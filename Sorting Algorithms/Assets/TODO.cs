/* **************************************** Stuff to do later *****************************************
 * > Clean up instruction
 *  - split into more groups (inheritage), ID's, I/J ?
 * 
 * > PseudoCode
 *  - copy pseudocode at the beginning to the fixed pseudocode viewer
 *  - clean up
 *      - go slightly back (2 methods to edit to change pseudocode)?
 *  - rather create a unit which fixes all blackboards?
 * 
 * > User Test
 *  - fix different levels of difficulty (how much help given, points etc)
 *  - count number of instructions user actually has to do and edit what'll be printed on blackboard
 *  - evaluation part: make correct statement about what went wrong (ReportError)
 *  
 *  
 * > Tutorial
 *  - disable drag (non-vr), touch/grab (vr)
 * 
 *
